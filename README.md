# FNSB Energy Burden Estimator

<br>

This repository contains code and data to build a static website used for estimating the average annual household energy costs as a share of total household income in the Fairbanks North Star Borough based on energy prices and census data. This website serves as a extension of the 2024 Borough commissioned report: [Energy Burden Analysis of the Fairbanks North Star Borough](https://zenodo.org/records/12575186). 

### Running the site locally
