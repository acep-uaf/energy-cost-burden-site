# FNSB Energy Burden Estimator

<br>

This repository contains code and data to build a static website used for estimating the average annual household energy costs as a share of total household income in the Fairbanks North Star Borough based on energy prices and census data. This website serves as a extension of the 2024 Borough commissioned report: [Energy Burden Analysis of the Fairbanks North Star Borough](https://zenodo.org/records/12575186). 

### Methodology
Details of the methodology used to calculate energy burden can be found in the [Wiki of this repository](https://github.com/acep-uaf/energy-cost-burden-site/wiki/Methodology)

### Running the site locally
In order to develop and run locally, install Hugo on your machine by following [this link](https://gohugo.io/installation/). Once you have Hugo installed, clone the repo, nagivate to the root directory, and run `hugo serve` to start the server. Navigate to the link provided in the terminal output (ex: `http://localhost:1313/`) to see the website.
